These are the profiles I use with AutoRecon. The profiles are located in the `~/.config/AutoRecon/` directory.

Note: **Do not forget that you usually run AutoRecon as root**, so don't forget to change the profiles in `/root/.config/AutoRecon/`, too.

## Changes

I've replaced ffuf web fuzzing with gobuster fuzzing, added some more gobuster scans and replaced the wordlists with my own combined wordlists from here:
