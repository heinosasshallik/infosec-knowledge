Cracking random()
---------------------
There are 31 numbers.
t_int32 numbers = new int[31]
Each additional number is calculated like:
numbers[index] = numbers[index] + numbers[index-3]

All the outputs are bitshifted to the right by one.
You can use some tricks to get the original numbers.

Most notably:
numbers[0] = 0001  //when bitshifted, shows up as 0000 in the outputs
numbers[3] = 0011  //when bitshifted, shows up as 0010
numbers[0] = numbers[0] + numbers[3] = 0100  //shows up as 0100
 
if either numbers[0] or numbers[3] didn't end with a 1, then the output would show 0010 instead.
----------------------------
Cracking rand() with range:
-----------------------------

Range algorithm:
tmax = pow(2,32)-1
max = highest number in range (included)
min = lowest number in range (included)
number2 = min + (long)( (double)(max-min+1.0)  *  number/(tmax+1.0)  )

long rounds downward.
(long)1.9999 == 1

To get number from number2 (this algorithm may be flawed. if max = tmax, then number_min should
equal number max, but it actually gives 1 as the answer):
number_min = (number2-min) / (max-min+1.0) * (tmax+1.0)
number_max = (number2+1.0 - min) / (max-min+1.0) * (tmax+1.0)

WAIT A SEC.
state[3] = state[3] + state[0]
if we roughly know state[3] and we roughly know state[0], we should be able to roughly calculate the next state[3], right?
DISCOVERY:
if outputs are in range [1...100], then output[3] + output[0] == output[3] (if output[3] + output[0] <= 100)
WTF? I thought the outputs were bitshifted and adding the outputs together isn't the same as adding the states together.
It is though! In 3/4 cases it's exactly the same (as adding the states and bitshifting), and even in the 1/4 cases where it's 
lower than adding the states, it has no significance, because when you round down to such a small range, a difference of 1
has no significance.

SOLUTION:
roughly calculate the original outputs (maybe take the arithmetic average of min and max),
bitshift them to the left, add them together, calculate the new value. 

I keep having a situation where all the sums were lowered by one, so the normal output was rarer and
normal output - 1 (num1 + num2 - 1) was more common. Why?

It seems to me that it should kind of be possible to do the first trick with the ranged output as well.
whether the actual output is num1+num2 or num1+num2-1, that tells us something.
if we get a number that's lower than we expected, then we can calculate its minimum value
(based on the minimums of the two numbers we used to calculate that number) and its maximum value
(based on the output + 0.99999999999). That way, we should start getting some pretty accurate results.

We would implement this by having not the previous values, but the previous ranges.
